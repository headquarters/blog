            I'm a user experience designer trapped inside a software engineer's body.
            I'm currently working as an Senior Software Design Engineer at <a href="http://www.payscale.com">PayScale</a>. Prior to PayScale, I worked
            as an Advisory Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>.

            In 2015 I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/">Master of Science in Information Science</a>,
            concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction. Before graduate school, I worked for several years as a web developer.
