          I'm a user experience designer trapped inside a web developer's body. I'm currently working as a Sr. Applications Engineer for TEKsystems on projects for their client <a href="http://redhat.com">Red Hat</a>. I recently graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/">Master of Science in Information Science</a>, concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction. I am a <a href="http://cua.humanfactors.com/profile/MichaelHead">Certified Usability Analyst</a>. Some of my code is available on <a href="https://github.com/headquarters">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/michaelehead">CodePen</a>. I occasionally answer questions on the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/148603/michael?tab=accounts">StackExchange</a> network (StackOverflow and UX). And I write about various technology and design topics here on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
