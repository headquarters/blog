            I'm a software enginner focusing on user interface development for the web. I have a strong personal interest in usability and 
            UX design. One of my favorite quotes is from Jef Raskin: "To the customer, the user interface is the software". Sound
            engineering is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a great user experience&mdash;great design is also necessary.

            I'm currently working as a Senior Software Design Engineer at <a href="http://www.payscale.com">PayScale</a>. Prior to PayScale, I worked
            as an Advisory Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>.
