            I'm a user experience designer trapped inside a software engineer's body.
            I'm currently working as an Advisory Software Engineer in a DevOps role at <a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>
            as part of an agile team that builds and supports the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/cloud/us/en-us">IBM Digital Marketplace</a>.
        </p>

            Prior to working at IBM, I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/">Master of Science in Information Science</a>,
            concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction. Before graduate school, I worked as a web developer&mdash;highlights of my
            work are in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
