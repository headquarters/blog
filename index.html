            I'm a software engineer focusing on user interface development. I have a strong personal interest in
            usability and
            UX design. One of my favorite quotes is from Jef Raskin: "To the customer, the user interface <em>is</em>
            the software". Sound
            engineering is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a great user experience&mdash;great design is
            also necessary.

            In 2015 I graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a <a href="http://sils.unc.edu/">Master of Science in
                Information Science</a>,
            concentrating in Human-Computer Interaction. Before graduate school, I worked for several years as a web
            developer.
