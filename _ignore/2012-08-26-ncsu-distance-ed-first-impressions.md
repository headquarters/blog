I just started the first semester of my graduate program in NC State's Master of Computer Science. This is a distance education program, so I have been and will continue to deal almost entirely with NC State's website, the Computer Science department website, NCSU's version of Moodle, and MyPack Portal. Since my first class is in Human Computer Interaction, I figured it would be worthwhile to give my first impressions of the various user interfaces I've seen, as well as the overall user experience. 
As a distance education student, being able to watch lectures is very important to me. So I was very dismayed to find that all lectures are watchable only with a Microsoft Silverlight plugin. That idea I had about laying back on my bed with my iPad to watch a lecture before going to bed? Nope, not gonna happen.
Alright, fine. Restricted to using my laptop to watch the lectures, I open the site in my web browser to find that the UI for the Engineering Online site takes up roughly half of the square pixels available on my 15" MacBook Pro. 

Well, that's no good. That video is extremely tiny, while the slide show on the right is only moderately bigger. And full-screen is somewhat useless, though, because the slide show disappears. Plus, there are no UI controls on the video in full screen. 

Fortunately, you can pop out the slides into their own window. Nonetheless, I feel there is probably a better interface for handling this scenario. Perhaps I will provide some more constructive suggestions to improve the interface in a future post.
