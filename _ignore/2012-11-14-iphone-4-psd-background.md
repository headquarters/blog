I created a PSD that is “actual size” for iPhone 4 screenshots. This was useful for me to create “demo” screenshots for a website:
Download the iPhone 4 PSD 
Take a normal screenshot on your iPhone 4 or iPhone 4s (Home + Power)
Get it on your computer somehow (syncing/email/etc)
Open the iPhone 4 PSD, then open the screenshot image
Copy the screenshot and paste it on to the iPhone 4 PSD layer
You may have to adjust it a few pixels, but it's the right size to accept a full screenshot
Export/resize/whatever you like as necessary
