	<p>Below are some random personal notes on UX design I’ve put together over the years. I’ve tried to site sources where it makes sense. This used to be a note on my computer, but I think it makes sense to share it here so others might find it useful.</p>

<hr />

<p>Systems cannot be purely “simple”. A single button is very simple, but provides no usefulness. Balance simplicity with functionality.</p>

<p><em>Everything</em> competes for attention.</p>

<p>Contrast is the strongest visual cue (Dondis, Primer on Visual Literacy).</p>

<p>If possible, avoid using <em>lorem ipsum</em> placeholder text in wireframes. It creates extra unnecessary cognitive load on 
users to decipher the language.</p>

<p>Minimize mouse movement (i.e. drag n’ drop). By minimizing mouse movement, we step around Fitts’ Law and
eliminate the need for fine-grain motor control in user interfaces.</p>

<p>Be mindful of unintended consequences. (Kind of an oxymoron, huh?)</p>

<p>User intentions and motivations are more stable than their preferences or actions. Preferences or actions can change when a system is upgraded, but the intentions and motivations rarely change.</p>

<p>Some things just aren’t intuitive: what is an “intuitive” hand gesture to change the color of a square from purple to yellow or duplicate a square? Every new thing has to be learned. (from a talk called Tenets+Traps at Microsoft Build)</p>

<p>Expectations drive attention: sometimes once you see something, you can’t stop seeing it. Especially relevant as a developer of 
user interfaces. (also Tenets+Traps)</p>

<p>Letters are shapes, too. Sometimes that’s all a foreign language speaker needs. “OK” and “TV” are examples.</p>

<p>Design is biased towards action. If you can’t take action on a problem, it’s not a problem, it’s a circumstance. A lot of people have a problem that isn’t a problem, it’s a circumstance. (adapted from http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=507901716)</p>
