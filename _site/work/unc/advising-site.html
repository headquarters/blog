	<p>
		As part of a 4 person team, I helped create and conduct a usability evaluation of the UNC Academic Advising website. 
		The Academic Advising website provides undergraduate students with information about their major, course scheduling advice, and lots of 
		other useful information for students seeking advising. However, the advising group felt the website could benefit from a usability
		evaluation to assess pain points and determine if there were areas of improvement for making the site more useful for students. 
	</p>

	<h2>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
	<p>
		Before creating a test plan, we conducted stakeholder interviews to determine pain points that we should explore. After talking with 
		advisors and the head of the advising site's digital content committee, we started working on a test plan that included a moderator guide
		and tasks. The tasks included finding required courses on the site, searching degree options, getting advice by student year, requesting
		more time to complete a degree, and scheduling time with an advisor. 
	</p>

	</figure>  

	<h2>Evaluations</h2>
	<p>
		Group members took turns moderating and note taking as we conducted 10 evaluation sessions. We used Camtasia to record videos of 
		users using the site. For gathering pre- and post-task questionnaire answers, we used Qualtrics. At the end of each session 
		users completed a System Usability Scale questionnaire
	</p>

		<figcaption>
			How satisfied users were with the time it took to complete a task. In this case, even though "Advice by Student Year"
			took longer (see the "time on task chart" above), that didn't necessarily bother people because they were OK with it taking longer. 
		</figcaption>
	</figure>   

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>
		We compiled qualitative and quantitative data into an executive summary to provide for the advising stakeholders. We also generated
		a full report for our professor. We found that exploring degree options was difficult for users (only 4 out of 10 users completed this task), but
		scheduling time with an advisor was very easy (10 out of 10 completions). Also, getting advice by student year (i.e. what to do as a Freshman, Sophomore, etc)
		was perceived to be one of the more difficult of all the tasks.
