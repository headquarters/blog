The new iOS 7 fade-in animation that occurs when turning on the device seemed slow to me, or at least slower than in iOS 6. So, I wanted to run a pseudo-scientific experiment to see if my perception was correct (“pseudo-scientific" due to the small sample size). I compared my iPhone 4S with iOS 7 to my wife's iPhone 4S with iOS 6 in terms of “time to home screen", which I defined as the time between pressing the power button, unlocking the screen, and waiting for the icons to come into place on the home screen.

For iOS 6, 5 runs: 2.11, 2.2, 2.07, 2.12, 2.06 (measured in seconds), with an average of 2.11 seconds.

For iOS 7, 5 runs: 2.3, 2.33, 2.51, 2.54, 2.47 (measured in seconds), with an average of 2.43 seconds. 

The difference comes out to **.32 seconds of extra time** waiting on animations before getting to the home screen in iOS 7. Now, that's not a whole lot of time; it's not even a full second. However, this is a task that users will do several times a day, perhaps even several times an hour, and that means extra fractions of a second wasted over millions of people. When a user interface has a major update, it should take less of our time to use it, not more.
