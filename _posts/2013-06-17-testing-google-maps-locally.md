When setting up your Google Maps API key, specify that it works on all subdomains, i.e. `*.mysite.com`. Then, create a host name in `/etc/hosts` (different path on Windows) that is something like "local.mysite.com" to point at 127.0.0.1. Now, instead of using â€œlocalhost" to access your site locally, you can use "local.mysite.com" to access it, and the Google Maps API will treat it as a legitimate site. Yay, no more API key error messages!
