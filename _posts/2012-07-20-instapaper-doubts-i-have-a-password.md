Instapaper requires an account to save content to "Read Later". On the account creation page, leaving the password field blank results in an error alert message.

So, a password is required. Later, when you use the Instapaper bookmarklet, if you are logged out, then you will be requested to login. The login form states, explicitly, that you __probably don't have a password__.

I wonder if a lot of people end up making duplicate accounts based on this simple form field help text? I think this is a usability oversight and would remove the help text since it misinforms users.
