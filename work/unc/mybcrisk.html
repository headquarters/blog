    <p>
        The website MyBCRisk.org ("My Breast Cancer Risk") is a questionnaire site that provides users with real time feedback on their 
        current health and behaviors. As users answer questions the site provides evidence-based responses to encourage positive behaviors or suggest changes to negative behaviors.

    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>
        MyBCRisk.org was a joint collaboration between the UNC School of Information Science and the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. Under the guidance of
        Professor Brad Hemminger, and with the help of another SILS student, I worked with stakeholders in the UNC Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program 
        to create a mobile-first, responsive design. This involved getting user feedback early and often in an iterative design process with paper and high fidelity
        prototypes.

            responsive design approach was a good idea.

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>
        The website utilizes progressive enhancement and responsive design to reach the largest user base possible. In terms of progressive enhancement, all links
        point at real resources on the server and forms do full POST requests without JavaScript on the client (with JavaScript on the client all forms submit via AJAX
        with server responses updating the client without a page reload). The responsive design is implemented utilizing the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation framework</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Session state management is done through cookies and URL parameters. This allows users to return to the site to review their results or finish the questionnaire
        for up to 30 days. The results are also shareable via URL, to show friends or family where a user is doing well or may need improvement (social support). 
        The database backing the site is PostgreSQL and the entire application ran on UNC's OpenShift instance.
