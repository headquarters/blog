        I created conceptual wireframes for a dashboard and for the Etix print-at-home ticket. 
        I worked with several stakeholders across the organization to gather requirements for the concepts.

    <h2>Dashboard Wireframe</h2>
    <p>
        At the time, the Etix.com landing page that venues accessed contained lists of links to different parts of the application. 
        The goal for a dashboard concept was to put data and actions in front of venue owners and operators so that they 
        didn't have to dig deeply into the application for things they accessed frequently.

    <h2>Print-at-home Ticket Wireframe</h2>
    <p>
        The original Etix print-at-home ticket provided users with a vertically oriented ticket on the left side of the printed page.

        This proved problematic for a few reasons. First, pages would sometimes print with premature page breaks, causing the ticket to span 2 pieces of paper. 
        Second, ticket scanning staff members observed that customers often folded tickets in half vertically for easier storage, which caused the 
        barcode to be on the "back side" of the folder paper. To tackle these two issues, I created a concept for our print-at-home ticket that would
        be less likely to print across 2 pages and also ensured the barcode was in the top quarter of the page.
