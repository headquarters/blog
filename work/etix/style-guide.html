         As the first front-end engineer ever employed at Etix, one of my first goals was to create and enforce some standards
         for our UI in terms of design and code. I started down this path by creating a functioning style guide document
         built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        The style guide covered visual design, some content topics, browser support, JavaScript standards, and many UI design and development topics.
        It paid special attention to designing highly usable forms, since the checkout form was central to the business.
