    <p>
        I implemented <a href="http://schema.org/">Schema.org metadata recommendations</a> on the Etix site in order to provide structured data in search results in supported search engines.
        This made heavy use of the Event, Organization, and Place schemas so that potential ticket buyers could get more useful search results.  
        The accompanying screenshot shows an example of this structured data being used by Google to improve search results.
