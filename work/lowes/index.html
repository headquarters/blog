        One of my first projects at Lowe's was a major overhaul of the HTML and CSS of Category pages (i.e. Appliances, Outdoor Living, etc).
        This involved updating Java Server Pages that dynamically rendered "eSpots" for cross-sell advertising. The markup
        and styles had to support variations of the base category page.

        As part of the Agile component team responsible for MyLowe's Lists functionality, I worked on building user interfaces that made heavy use of AJAX to
        dynamically update data in users' saved items lists.

        I also worked on a proof of concept iPad app for MyLowe's user registration&mdash;built with PhoneGap. 
        Researching how to use the front facing camera through PhoneGap in 2012 led to <a href="/2012/03/27/defaulting-to-front-facing-camera-on-ipad-with.html">this blog post</a>.
