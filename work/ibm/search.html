    <p>
        As part of the same team maintaining the <a href="/work/ibm/marketplace.html">IBM Digital Marketplace storefront</a>, 
        I wrote UI components and unit tests for the search results pages of the Digital Marketplace. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This application had its own CI/CD pipeline setup that we maintained, consisting of GitHub Enterprise, TravisCI, and 
        Bluemix. Search results were rendered from an Elastic Search endpoint that another team maintained as a microservice.
