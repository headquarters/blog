    <h2 id="ibm-marketplace-usability">Usability Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        As part of an ad-hoc formative analysis of the IBM Digital Marketplace, I created a moderator guide and trained
        several others to conduct usability evaluations leading up to the All Things Open conference in 2015. At the conference,
        we had a booth where we conducted usability evaluations of the Marketplace storefront pages as well as a prototype of 
        a SaaS user administration page. I conducted some of the evaluations myself, but my role in the process was largely advisory.
