    <p>
        As part of a team practicing DevOps in the IBM Cloud Division, I helped create page templates and UI components for the IBM 
        Digital Marketplace "storefront". This consisted of the landing page and product detail pages. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Pages and components were built with Node.js and React and server-rendered for performance and SEO value. On the operations side,
        we set up and maintained our own CI/CD pipeline consisting of GitHub Enterprise, TravisCI, and Bluemix and took on-call
        rotation for parts of the application that our team was responsible for. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Our team maintained high code standards through pull requests with code reviews, linting, and 100% code coverage for lines of 
        code that were customer-facing. Our application rendered pages from data stored in a Cloudant (CouchDB) database.

    <h2 id="ibm-marketplace-usability">Usability Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        As part of an ad-hoc formative analysis of the IBM Digital Marketplace, I created a moderator guide and trained
        several others to conduct usability evaluations leading up to the All Things Open conference in 2015. At the conference,
        we had a booth where we conducted usability evaluations of the Marketplace storefront pages as well as a prototype of 
        a SaaS user administration page. I conducted some of the evaluations myself, but my role in the process was largely advisory.
